                    <p>After completing my undergrad in Malaysia I came back to my home country in April and after that I didn't work for a few days. Finally I got a contract with a Malaysian company to develop a web application from August and am currently working with them.</p>

                        <li>We have started making the application dynamic since September. It is a large web application system with several functionalities. The system is being developed to manage gaming society connectivity and gaming events</li>
                        <li>While working on this system I feel pretty good at creating programming logic  </li>
